### Token Based Authentication

```
*) exchange username & password with token
*) token is valid until it blocked or deleted

NB: JWT based authentication is better than token based authentication.
    Because, JWT based authentication have two types of token access-token
    & refresh-token. access-token is valid for a short time & refresh-token
    can make a access-token.
```
